1. Run `code/scrape_literatures.py`, output text files in `text`, each text is a work from an author.  

2. Run `code/text_to_num.py`, converts each work into a list of words excluding stopwords. 

3. Run `Analysis_1.py`, Converts list of words into dataframe containing all words in universe 

4. Run `Vector.py`, Uses each column of dataframe as an array that is compared with cosine similarity. Table are created that make visualizations of scores easier.

5. Run `euclidian.py`. Does the same thing as vector above but calculates euclidian distance between columns. 

6. Run `flesch-kincaid` to get the data analyisis that goes to flesch-kincaid  directory. 

7. Run `sentiment` that uses outside package textblob
To do:  
Format the code eventually!
